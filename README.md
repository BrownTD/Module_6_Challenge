# San Fransisco Housing Data Analysis 2010-2016


There is a positive correlation between the increase in gross rent and sales price per sq.ft. for the San Francisco housing data. The trend in the overall rental income growth for the San Fransisco area increases at a much greater rate than that of the sales price. It is also worthy to note that there has been a consitent increase in the number of housing units availbale in the San Fransisco area between 2010 and 2016, suggesting that the houses on the market have seen growth in demand and value. This however is not a general consensus of San Fransisco's housing data and does not hold true for all neighborhoods across area such as Alamo Sqaure and Ingleside, neighborhoods which saw a decrease in their sales prices between 2015 & 2016.

Through this model, I have been able to analyze and compare San Francisco's housig data and utilize interactive visualizations to optimize my ability to identify potential investments. While the data plots I created focus on market factors such as sales price per sqaure foot and gross rent, many other factors, such as crime rate and renter demographics, could be compared using the same code found in this model. The model streamlines the buying/renting process for real estate investments. I woud advise investment in the Vistacion Valley Neighborhood because of its high rental income growth and very low sales prices. This purchase would produce the greatest profit from investment.
